# What I do / Who I am to you.

My name is Motoko, I am a novice software developer and scripting programmer.
I usually work on or try to assist open-source projects that can be deployed on any operating system.
I do a little bit of practice here and there in Python, but my main interest is systems-automation currently.
Other than that, I create 3D artwork, produce music, and help people with tech issues in GNU/Linux :).
